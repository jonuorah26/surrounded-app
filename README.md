Surrounded App

Surrounded is a real-time debate moderation app inspired by Jubilee’s Surrounded segment. It allows a moderator to create a session where participants can raise flags (Red or Green) to influence the flow of discussion. The app features:
	•	Session Management: Moderators can create and manage debate sessions.
	•	Real-Time Flag System: Participants can raise Red Flags (to vote out a speaker) or Green Flags (to extend their time).
	•	Participant List: Moderators can view and manage participants.
	•	Live Updates: Firestore is used to sync flag statuses and participant actions in real-time.
	•	Navigation & State Management: The app is built with React Native Navigation and Redux for smooth user experience and state handling.

This project is developed using React Native and Firebase Firestore for real-time data synchronization.
